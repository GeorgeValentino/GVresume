        <p>
            1985 - 2000
            <br>
        As a teenager i worked in the family business which was wedding catering 
        and co-ordinating. we catered for every aspect for weddings, engagements and any sepcial occasion.
        We would accomadate guests from 200 - 1000. We provided everything from menus, photographers, music, flowers
        and vehicles.
      <br>
      <p>
      2002- 2004
      <br>
      I started my own dry cleaning business, offering a door to door service, whic was my USP, employing people that would 
      collect the dryclening and deliver. I would offer a key cut service and shoe repairs. 
      <p>
        2004 - 2006 
        <br>
        I sold the dry cleaners as my mother passed away and needed to take time out. I got a job with a paint protection film
        company. The company accomadated cad shapes usuing polyurethanes to prevent stone chips. I wanted to integrate the idea 
        with the aviation industry. The company didnt believe in my idea so I left and launched my own infrustcture. 
        <p>
      2007 - 2009 
      <br>
      I launched my own company in aviation airframe and leading edge protection.This was a revolutionising idea in the 
      aviation industry, giving me recognition as the invetor and creator on the anti erosion leading edge kit.
      The kit is a recognised part for the BAe 146 aircraft, approved by the cilvil aviation authority.
      I sucessfully sold the company.
      <p>
      2009 - Present

      The tradition of Tarot and readings has been in my famil for over 120 years. My mother performed readings and I was 
      taught these skills as a child. I started to read for friends which then lead on to me being in over 136 magazines
      and many prime time televison performancs. I started off launching in the UK and now have offices in the USA, Australia,
      South Africa. I employ over 60 readers that work with me from all over the world.
